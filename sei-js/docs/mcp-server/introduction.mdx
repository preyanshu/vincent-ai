## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Setup">
    **Read-only mode** - Perfect for blockchain queries, documentation lookup, and analysis without transaction capabilities.
    
    <Note>
    **Safe by Default**: Wallet tools are disabled until you explicitly configure a private key.
    </Note>
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sei": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **What you can do:**
    - Query balances and transaction history
    - Search Sei documentation
    - Analyze blockchain data
    - Generate boilerplate code
    - Get network status and block info
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="With Wallet Connection">
    **Transaction capabilities** - Adds wallet tools for sending tokens, deploying contracts, and blockchain interactions.
    
    <Warning>
    **Security Critical**: Only use test wallets with minimal funds. Never commit private keys to version control.
    </Warning>
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sei": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"],
          "env": {
            "WALLET_MODE": "private-key",
            "PRIVATE_KEY": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Additional capabilities:**
    - Send tokens and execute transactions
    - Deploy and interact with smart contracts
    - Manage NFT collections
    - Stake and delegate tokens
    - All read-only features included
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Full Configuration">
    **Advanced setup** - Complete environment variable configuration for custom RPC endpoints, transport modes, and server settings.
    
    See the [Environment Variables](/mcp-server/environment-variables) documentation for all available options and detailed explanations.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "sei": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@sei-js/mcp-server"],
          "env": {
            "WALLET_MODE": "private-key",
            "PRIVATE_KEY": "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
            "SERVER_TRANSPORT": "streamable-http",
            "SERVER_PORT": "8080",
            "SERVER_PATH": "/mcp",
            "MAINNET_RPC_URL": "https://evm-rpc.sei-apis.com",
            "TESTNET_RPC_URL": "https://evm-rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com",
            "DEVNET_RPC_URL": "https://evm-rpc-arctic-1.sei-apis.com"

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that connects AI systems with custom prompts, tools and data sources (context). It enables things like:

- **Real-time blockchain data access** - Get current balances, transaction history, and network status directly from Sei
- **Full execution and write operations** - Deploy contracts, execute transactions, and interact with smart contracts (with wallet configured)
- **Up-to-date documentation access** - Search both main Sei docs and Sei-JS package documentation for comprehensive guidance
- **Specialized blockchain capabilities** - Access Sei-specific features like precompiles and native token operations
- **Create boilerplate code** - Generate code for Sei projects using the latest patterns

The Sei MCP Server leverages this protocol to bring all of this and more directly to your LLM enabled tools, allowing for natural language interactions with Sei.

## Why Use Sei MCP Server?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Natural Language Blockchain Operations" icon="comments">
    Interact with Sei blockchain using conversational commands like "What's my SEI balance?" or "Send 1 SEI to this address" instead of complex API calls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="AI-Powered Analysis" icon="brain">
    Get intelligent insights about transactions, contracts, and market data with built-in analysis capabilities powered by your AI assistant.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multi-Platform Support" icon="desktop">
    Works seamlessly with Cursor IDE, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and custom applications through standardized MCP integration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Comprehensive Toolkit" icon="toolbox">
    Access 29 blockchain tools covering token management, NFT operations, smart contract interactions, network monitoring, and documentation search.
  </Accordion>

## Example Queries

```text
"Get me the transactions in the latest block and tell me what they did."
"How do I query staking my delegations using Viem?"
"Generate a boilerplate dApp with Sei Global Wallet connection"
"What's my SEI balance?"
"Send 1 SEI to this address"
```
