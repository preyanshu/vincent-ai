## üö® Safety Considerations

1. **Backup**: Consider backing up job data before clearing
2. **Monitoring**: Use the queue status endpoint to verify the operation
3. **Recovery**: After clearing, you'll need to recreate any necessary jobs
4. **Database**: Jobs are marked as failed, not deleted from the database
5. **Queue**: The entire BullMQ queue is obliterated and will be empty after the operation

---

## üîÑ Recovery After Clear

After clearing all jobs, you may need to:

1. **Restart the job runner** to ensure clean state
2. **Recreate essential jobs** that were cleared
3. **Check database** for any jobs that need manual status updates
4. **Monitor logs** for any errors during the clear operation
